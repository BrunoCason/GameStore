# ðŸ“„ Project Description

This project aims to create a website for a fictional game store, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Two pages were created following the original design prototyped in Figma, where the first is the homepage, and the second is the contact page. The goal is to maintain fidelity to the original design while implementing some of the necessary features for a complete user experience.

# ðŸ“‹ Requirements 

- Exclusive use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on external libraries.
- All form fields on both pages are validated using JavaScript.
- Data entered in the forms is stored locally using the browser's LocalStorage.
- Implementation of a dedicated error screen to handle unexpected situations during navigation in the project.

# ðŸ—‚ Open and Run the Project
